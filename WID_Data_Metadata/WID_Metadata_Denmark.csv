DK;Denmark;sptinc992j;p90p100;share;Pre-tax national income. Share Adults. equal-split adults;Pre-tax national income share held by a given percentile group. Pre-tax national income  is the sum of all pre-tax personal income flows accruing to the owners of the production factors, labor and capital, before taking into account the operation of the tax/transfer system, but after taking into account the operation of pension system. The central difference between personal factor income and pre-tax income is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by factor income and on a distribution basis by pre-tax income. The population is comprised of individuals over age 20. The base unit is the individual (rather than the household) but resources are split equally within couples.;Pre-tax national income =Pre-tax labor income [total pre-tax income ranking]+Pre-tax capital income [total pre-tax income ranking];Fiscal income rescaled to match the macroeconomic aggregates.;WID.world computations using fiscal and net national income.
